The goal of horseEvo is to create an interactive website featuring the evolution of the horse over geologic time. This site will integrate information from phylotastic.org, the paleobiology database, and possibly others. 

Much of the code for horseEvo was originally developed for the History of Earth website (historyofearth.net https://github.com/jwiggi18/HistoryOfEarth) and has been adapted for this application. Brian O'Meara (bomeara) is the primary author of the map visualizations and code for the trees comes from Dave Bapst's (dwbapst) paleotree (https://github.com/dwbapst/paleotree).

## Installation

horseEvo is under development, check back for a launch soon!
